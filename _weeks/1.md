## Background

In General Chemistry, you learned about the \\(s\\), \\(p\\), \\(d\\), \\(\ldots\\) orbitals of the hydrogen atom, and their associated quantum numbers:
- \\(n\\): The "principal" quantum number that determines the electron's "shell" and its energy. Allowed values are positive nonzero integers: \\(1, 2, 3, \ldots.\\)
- \\(\ell\\): The orbital angular momentum quantum number, which determines the orbital's shape \\(s, p, d, \ldots.\\) Allowed values are \\(0, 1, \ldots, n-1.\\)
- \\(m\\): The orbital angular momentum projection quantum number, which determines the orbital's orientation. Allowed values go from \\(+\ell\\) to \\(-\ell\\) in steps of 1.

These numbers come from a quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom: they are the solutions to the Schrödinger equation

\\[ \hat{\mathbf H}\psi = E\psi \\]

In this equation, \\(\hat{\mathbf H}\\) is the **Hamiltonian operator**, which is the quantum mechanical representation of the energy of the system, \\(\psi\\) is the **wavefunction**, the physical state of the system, and \\(E\\) is the energy of the system.
A hydrogen atom consists of a proton whose mass is \\(m_p\\) and charge \\(+e\\) that is being orbited by an electron of mass \\(m_e\\) and charge \\(-e\\).
If the proton is placed at the origin of the coordinate system, to a very good approximation the energy of the system is just given by the kinetic energy of the electron orbiting the stationary proton and the potential energy due to the electrostatic interaction between the negative and positive charges.
Using the quantum mechanical operators for position and momentum (beyond the scope of this course!), the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in SI units is

\\[ \hat{\mathbf H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 d}.\\]

- \\(\hbar \equiv h/2\pi\\) is Planck's constant divided by \\(2\pi\\). \\(\hbar\\) is approximately \\(1.05457\times 10^{-34}\\) J\\(\cdot\\)s.
- \\(m_e\\) is the mass of the electron, which is about \\(9.109\times 10^{-31}\\) kg.
- \\(\nabla^2 \equiv \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \\) is the quantum mechanical momentum of the electron.
- \\(e\\) is the fundamental unit of charge, about \\(1.602\times 10^{-19}\\) C.
- \\(\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space, a fundamental constant. Its value is approximately \\(8.8542\times 10^{-12} \frac{\text{C}^2}{\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2}\\).
- \\(d\\) is the distance of the electron from the proton in meters. At position (x,y,z), \\(d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\).

Given all the numbers above, it is much more convenient to work in [atomic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units) (a.u.), which redefines units of length, mass, charge, and action in terms of fundamental constants.

| Dimension | Term | SI Value | SI Units | a.u. Value | a.u. Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| action | \\(\hbar\\) | \\(1.05457\times 10^{-34}\\) | J\\(\cdot\\)s | 1 | \\(\hbar \\) |
| charge | \\(e\\) | \\(1.602\times 10^{-19}\\) | C | 1 | \\(e\\) |
| length | \\(a_0\\) | \\(5.2918\times10^{−11}\\) | m | 1 | \\( \frac{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \\) |
| mass | \\(m_e\\) | \\(9.109\times 10^{-31}\\) | kg | 1 | \\(m_e\\) |
| energy | \\(E_h\\) | \\(4.360\times 10^{-18}\\) | J | 1 | \\( \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e a_0^2} \\) |

The quantity \\(a_0\\) is called the **Bohr radius**, and \\(E_h\\) is the **Hartree**.
In atomic units, the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom becomes

\\[ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{r} \\]

where \\(r\\) is now the distance of the electron from the proton in units of \\(a_0\\).
The Schrödinger equation in atomic units is

\\[ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\psi(x,y,z) - \frac{1}{r}\psi(x,y,z) = E\psi(x,y,z) \\]

where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) refer to the position of the electron in units of \\(a_0\\), and \\(E\\) is the energy of the electron in Hartree.
Solving this equation consists of finding combinations of energy and \\(\psi\\) that make the equality hold.
It turns out that the easiest way to solve the equation is to convert to [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system) \\(r\\), \\(\theta\\), and \\(\phi\\):

![sperical coordinates image - Andeggs Public Domain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/3D_Spherical.svg)

| Cartesian | Spherical | Domain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \\(x = r \sin \theta \cos \phi\\) | \\(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\) | \\(r \in [0,\infty) \\) |
| \\(y = r \sin \theta \sin \phi\\) | \\( \theta = \arccos \frac{z}{r} \\) | \\(\theta \in [0,\pi] \\) |
| \\(z = r \cos \theta \\) | \\( \phi = \arctan \frac{y}{x} \\) | \\(\phi \in [0,2\pi) \\) |

Here we are primarily concerned with the wavefunctions \\(\psi\\).
In sperical coordinates and atomic units, the wavefunction for quantum numbers \\(n\\), \\(\ell\\), and \\(m\\) is:

\\[\psi_{n\ell m}(r,\theta,\phi) = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2}{n} \right)^3 \frac{ (n-\ell-1)! }{2n(n+\ell)!} } e^{-r/2} r^\ell Y_\ell^m(\theta,\phi) L^{2\ell+1}_{n-\ell-1}(r)\\]


<!--Because we're dealing with rotation, it's more natural to work in spherical coordinates, and after some tedious calculus it can be shown that:
\begin{displaymath}
 \nabla^2 = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( r^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \right)_{\theta,\phi}
            + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \right)_{r,\phi}
            + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} \right)_{r,\theta}
\end{displaymath}
In the rigid rotor, $r$ is constant, so we can eliminate the first term to get
\begin{equation}
 \nabla^2 = \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \right)_{r,\phi}
            + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} \right)_{r,\theta} \label{chap:intro:eq:delsphere}
\end{equation}

Recall from physics that angular momentum $L = I\omega$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
Relative to the center of mass, $I = m_1r_1^2 + m_2r_2^2$, and consequently in the center-of-mass frame $I = \mu r^2$.
The kinetic energy of a rotating body is $T = L^2/(2I)$ (just like the linear quantity $T = p^2/(2m)$).
If we now substitute Equation~\eqref{chap:intro:eq:delsphere} into the Hamiltonian, we see
\begin{equation}
 \op{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\left[\frac{1}{\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \right)_{r,\phi}
            + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} \right)_{r,\theta}\right],
\end{equation}
and thus we find the quantum mechanical form of the square of the angular momentum operator:
\begin{equation}
 \op{L}^2 = -\hbar^2\left[\frac{1}{\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \right)_{r,\phi}
            + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} \right)_{r,\theta}\right].
\end{equation}

The eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (and $\op{L}^2$) are the spherical harmonics $Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)$, where $l = 0,1,2,\ldots$ and $m = 0, \pm1, \pm2,\ldots,\pm l$.
These spherical harmonics have the form:
\begin{equation}
 Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) = \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-|m|)!}{4\pi(l+|m|)!}}P_l^{|m|}(\cos \theta)e^{im\phi},
\end{equation}
where $P_l^{|m|}(\cos \theta)$ are the associated Legendre functions.

The energies of the rigid rotor depend only on the $l$ quantum number
\begin{equation}
 E_l = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}l(l+1), \quad l = 0,1,2,\ldots,
\end{equation}
and each energy level has a degeneracy of $2l+1$ arising from the possible values of the $m$ quantum number.
While the quantum numbers $l$ and $m$ (often $m_l$) are used when describing the angular portion of the hydrogen atom wavefunction, typically the quantum numbers become $J$ and $m_J$ when discussing molecular rotation.
They are equivalent in the case of linear molecules; for nonlinear molecules, additional quantum numbers are needed to specify the projection of the angular momentum onto some molecular axis, and the energy depends on these quantum number as well.

\end{figure}


As mentioned before, $\op{L}^2$ commutes with $\op{H}$, so the square of the total angular momentum has a definite value ($l$ is a good quantum number).
Looking at its components $\op{L}_x$, $\op{L}_y$, and $\op{L}_z$, we find that only $[\op{L}^2,\op{L}_z] = 0$, while $[\op{L}_i,\op{L}_j] \neq 0$ if $i \neq j$.
This means that we can know the total angular momentum $l$ and its projection $m$ onto one of three axes (under the coordinate system we've chosen, that axis is $z$, but different coordinate choices are possible).

\subsection{Hydrogen atom} \label{sec:intro:hydrogen}

For the hydrogen atom, we let the nucleus be defined as the center of our coordinate system, and the Hamiltonian becomes:
\begin{displaymath}
 \op{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r},
\end{displaymath}
where $r$ is the electron distance, $\nabla^2$ is in spherical coordinates as before, $e$ is the charge of the electron, and the Coulombic term is negative to indicate that the proton-electron potential is attractive (i.e., the proton and electron have charges that are opposite in sign).
The factor $4\pi\epsilon_0$ comes from using SI units; the factor disappears if using atomic units.
The solution to this equation is tedious, but it turns out that the method of separation of variables can be used to solve this system in terms of radial and angular components:
\begin{displaymath}
 \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)Y(\theta,\phi).
\end{displaymath}
The angular solutions are the same as those for the rigid rotor: the spherical harmonics $Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)$, so the hydrogen atom wavefunctions have quantum numbers $l$ and $m_l$.
You are already familiar with these from general chemistry, $l=0$ corresponds to an $s$ orbital, $l=1$ is a $p$ orbital, and so on.

It is found that the energy of the hydrogen atom depends only on a single quantum number $n$, even though full specification of the wavefunction also requires the quantum numbers $l$ and $m_l$:
\begin{equation}
 E_n = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0a_0n^2},\quad n=1,2,\ldots,
\end{equation}
where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius.
The allowed quantum numbers are $n = 1,2,3,\ldots$, $0 \leq l \leq n$, and $0 \leq |m_l| \leq l$.-->

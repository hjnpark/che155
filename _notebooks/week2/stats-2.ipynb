    "## Statistics and Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis for most statistical analysis is comparing the properties of a dataset to theoretical distributions. These are precisely-defined mathematical functions, and as we will see they provide a basis for us to compute the likelihood of obtaining a certain result by pure chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started though, a couple imporant caveats:\n",
    "1. **Statistical analysis is not one-size-fits-all!** The various statistical tests we will discuss are based on certain assumptions about the \"true\" data that may not apply in all situations. We will only be showing tests based on the simplest possible cases, and before applying these tests to any real problem you should study them in much greater detail than we will do here. Doing bad statistical analysis is easy.\n",
    "2. **Statistical analysis is descriptive, not expositive!** Statistics and statistical tests ultimately come down to different ways to describe data. They do not explain what the data mean, and they do not provide unambiguous truth. A $p$-value can tell the probability of obtaining a certain result if the null hypothesis is true, and is often used to reject the null hypothesis at some confidence level. However, it does not mean that a particular alternative hypothesis is correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the week's introduction, the most common and powerful theoretical distribution function is the [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left[{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation ($\\sigma^2$ is the variance). From a sample of the population, we can estimate the population mean with the *sample mean* $\\bar{x}_s$, which may be different than the population mean. We can demonstrate the implications using functions in the [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`scipy.stats.norm`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html) function creates a normal distribution object, and there are a variety of functions for modeling the distribution or pulling random samples. For instance, to look at the probability density function, we can use `scipy.stats.norm.pdf`:"

    "\n",
    "The vast majority of the time, we do not know the population mean, so we cannot truly calculate the $t$ statistic for our sample. However, the $t$ distribution gives us the theoretical distribution of $t$ values that we might expect to observe for any assumed population mean. Let's consider the scaled $t$ statistics with $\\nu=4$, as we plotted above. The $t$ distribution is getting pretty small when $t < -3$ and $t > 3$. Another way of visualizing the disrtibution of $t$ statistics is with the [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function), which tells what fraction of values in the distribution are less than or equal to a given value $x$. In `scipy.stats`, all of the continuous distributions are subclasses of the [`scipy.stats.rv_continous`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.html) class, and there are a variety of functions we can call (we've already seen [`rv_continuous.pdf`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.pdf.html) and [`rv_continous.rvs`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.rvs.html)). The cumulative distribution function is [`rv_continuous.cdf`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.cdf.html), which we plot below. Another useful function is [`rv_continuous.interval`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.interval.html), which takes an argument `alpha` and returns the range containing 100*`alpha`% of the values in the distribution, centered around the median. Below we show that 95% of scaled $t$ values fall between -2.777 and +2.777 for $\\nu=4$ (i.e., $N=5$)."

When setting `loc` to the sample mean and `scale` to the standard error of the mean, the $t$ distribution is scaled to the measurement, and the `interval` function directly gives the desired confidence interval. In the code below, you can adjust the number of trials, the desired confidence interval, and the sample size.

    "\n",
    "In science, hypothesis testing is one of the most common uses of statistical analysis. There are many, many different kinds of statistical tests (we have already seen the Jarque-Bera test, for instance), but they all involve assuming that certain aspects of sampled data will be represented by theoretical distributions. Under that assumption, a statistic is calculated for the dataset and compared to the properties of the theoretical distribution, which yields a p-value. Here we will look at a few of the more common statistical tests.\n",

    "### $t$-tests\n",

    "The $t$ tests are a family of methods based on the $t$ statistic. The null hypothesis is that a set of samples is drawn from a normal distribution, and therefore that the sample mean follows the $t$ distribution. There are many types of $t$ tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-sample** $t$ tests check if the population mean is equal to a specified value. With a p-value of 0.05, this is equivalent to asking whether the assumed population mean lies within the computed 95\\% condifence interval.\n",
    "- **Two-sample** $t$ tests check whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution.\n",
    "- **One-sided**, **two-sided**, **paired**, and **unpaired** $t$ tests will be discussed a bit later once we've established the basics.\n",

    "A one-sample $t$ test can be performed with the [`scipy.stats.ttest_1samp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_1samp.html) function. We provide the data and the assumed population mean, and the function computes the $t$ statistic as we did before, returning both $t$ and the associated $p$-value from the cumulative distribution function. For instance, we could test whether the population mean for men is 173 cm at a significance level of 95% (p < 0.05). The null hypothesis is that our sample is indistinguishable from a population mean of 173 cm. The computed $t$ value is 7.19, which corresponds to a p value of 9e-13. This means that if the average height of men is really 173 cm, then if we randomly sample 1985 men over and over again independently, we would only get a sample mean that is different from 173 cm by an amount equal or greater than our observed sample mean ($|173 - 174.2| = 1.2$ cm) at a rate less than 1 time in every 1,200,000,000,000 trials if it is indeed true that the population mean is 173 cm and the population variance is well-approximated by the sample variance. At a significance level of 95% (p < 0.05), then, we can reject the null hypothesis."

    "Importantly, the statement above does not mean that there is only a 9e-13 chance that the population mean is 173 cm! If for some reason our sample happens to have a smaller variance than the true population variance, then our esimate of the population variance is poor, and our calculated confidence interval shrinks. If you go back above to the plot of confidence intervals, you can see that sometimes the computed confidence interval is very small. This occurs when the values of the samples just happen to be close together, and this can occur by chance. In a single trial, you have no way of knowing if this is the case for your data. This is why the p-value should not be interepreted as a probability. The proper use of a statistical test is to establish a significance level that is acceptable before the experiment is performed. If the computed p value is smaller than the threshold significance level, then the null hypothesis can be rejected. Sometimes, the null hypothesis will be falsely rejected. By choosing a significance level of 95%, it means if the null hypothesis is actually true, you will falsely reject it once out of every 20 repeat tests. The appropriate significance level depends on the application: especially what the potential harm might be if you falsely reject the null hypothesis. If it's a life-or-death scenario, perhaps you want a 99.995% significance level or higher, but if there's little harm in being wrong, maybe a 90% significance level is acceptable."

    "A two-sample $t$ test can be used to compare the sample means for 2 groups: such as height data for men and women. The null hypothesis is that the population mean is equal for the groups. For our data, the two-sample $t$ test imagines the following scenario: assume we were to take samples of 2197 women and 1985 men randomly from the population many, many times. Each time we calculate the sample means. How often would we find a difference between the two that is just as large (or larger) as the one we observed in our real sample if the population means are actually the same? The $t$ statistic is computed by dividing the difference of the sample means by the standard error of the difference. In the classical [Student's $t$ test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test), the calculation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{s,1} - \\bar{x}_{s,2}}{ \\sqrt{\\frac{S_1^2 + S_2^2}{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}}} $$\n",

    "However, this test assumes that $N_1 = N_2 = N$ and that $S_1^2 \\approx S_2^2$. Student's $t$ test can only be used when the sample sizes are equal and their variances are very similar. Forunately, there is an improved version called [Welch's $t$ test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test) that does away with these assumptions by rescaling the sample variances by the sample sizes:\n",

When `equal_var=False`, it's Welch's $t$ test. In practice, it should always be set to `False`. Applying this test to our samples we get a $t$ statistic of 60.2, which corresponds to a p value that is smaller than the smallest floating point number that can be represented. This is as close to conclusive as it is possible to be with statistics. No matter what significance level we had initially chosen, the null hypothesis would be rejected."

In some fields, a standard has evolved that in order for an experiment to be publishable, the results must be significant at the 95% level, and therefore the p value must be below 0.05. It could be tempting to start with a two-tailed $t$ test, obtain a p value of 0.07, and then switch to a one-tailed $t$ test that would decrease the p value to 0.035, meeting the standard for publication. This is not only scientifically invalid, it is scientific misconduct: manipulating the data to obtain a favorable result. Because of the perverse incentived surrounding p < 0.05, journals are moving away from this hard threshold and instead preferring that p-values are reported along with confidence intervals so that reviewers (and readers) can judge for themselves how significant the results are.

For instance, if you were testing a weight-loss treatment, you might record the participants' weights before and after the treatment. The $t$ test is then performed using the difference in weight between the two samples, and the null hypothesis is that the average change in weight is 0 (e.g., similar to a one-sample $t$ test compared to 0). If you were testing for weight loss, you might choose to use a one-sided $t$ test to see if the average weight change is negative at your desired level of significance.

These unscaled variances are then divided by the number of degrees of freedom for each calculation (for the global mean, it is the number of groups minus 1, and for the within-group variance it is the total number of data points minus the number of groups) to give the global and within-group **mean-square** variances (MSVs). The ratio of the global MSV to the within-group MSV is called the **$F$-ratio**, which can then be compared to the cumulative distribution function of the [$F$-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution) to calculate the ANOVA test statistic and p-value.

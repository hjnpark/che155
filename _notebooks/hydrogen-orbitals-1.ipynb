If this is the first time you've worked with one, please take a moment to briefly read [these instructions](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#structure-of-a-notebook-document) explaining how to use it. In particular, make sure you understand the difference between a Markdown cell used for text/images/equations (such as the current one) and a code cell, which executes python code. When you do problem sets in this course, you will be expected to submit Jupyter Notebook files that have a mix of explanatory text and working code.\n",

    "Let's start by writing a python function that will calculate the value of the wavefunction at a point in space. To do so, the function requires $r$, $\\theta$, $\\phi$, $n$, $\\ell$, and $m$. We also see that we need to evaluate factorials, a generalized Laguerre polynomial $L^{2\\ell+1}_{n-\\ell-1}(r)$, and a spherical harmonic function Y_\\ell^m(\\theta,\\phi). In your earlier experience with python, you have probably encountered the [math.factorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/math.html#math.factorial) function, but the standard python libraries do not have pre-existing implementations of $L^{2\\ell+1}_{n-\\ell-1}(r)$ and $Y_\\ell^m(\\theta,\\phi)$. These functions are, however, available in SciPy, so you can save a lot of time using a premade implementation rather than writing your own. In addition, the functions available in SciPy are often based on well-known and studied implementations, and are much more likely to be efficient and bug-free than one you would come up with yourself. Where possible, always try to make use of SciPy and NumPy, as we will do in this course.\n",

On the documentation page, you will find links to documentation for different versions of SciPy and NumPy, so you need to select the version you are using. If you're not sure, it is easy to check.

It may seem like this shouldn't work. After all, our function was written to expect a single value of `r`, and now we're giving it an array. However, all of NumPy and SciPy's functions are [universal functions](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html), and when they see an array as an argument, they *automatically* operate element-by-element on the array. Furthermore, because arrays are of fixed size and shape, the code is [vectorized](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/glossary.html#term-vectorization), and NumPy under the hood calls C-based implementations of loops that are much, much faster than python's `for` loops.

As explained in the documentation if we have a set of 100 x coordinates and a set of 100 y coordinates for a 2D function, and we want to evaluate at each x,y pair, we can axxomplish this by making `x` and `y` each 2D arrays with different shapes. `x` can be a 100x1 array (shape `(100,1)`), `y` can be a 1x100 array (shape `(1,100)`), and when we call `func(x,y)`, the output will be a 100x100 array (shape `(100,100)`).\n",

    "In my trial this was about 3000 times faster than the python `for` loops! The take-home point of this section is that whenever possible, you should avoid using python's built-in `for` or `while` loops to loop through NumPy arrays. In fact, many other loop applications can also be avoided by clever use of `ndarray` and broadcasting, and in general this approach will be much faster. You can always test the performance of a code snippet with the `%timeit` magic function that we have been using; it's often a good way to identify performance bottlenecks and test ways to improve them.\n",

Below we will begin generating plots, and the focus will mostly be on the hydrogen orbitals and the NumPy details, not on every matplotlib call. The usage guide will provide more explanation of many of the basics, and the API documentation for the [Axes](https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html) and [Figure](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.figure.Figure.html) objects have many more details and options.\n",

While we could simply use 1D arrays for $r$ and $\\psi$, we will still do the calculation in 3D so that our code is flexible. For this calculation, we'll use 1000 $r$ points, and 100 $\\theta$ and $\\pi$ points."

First we need to import the library and create a new set of `Figure` and `Axes` objects. The `Figure` is like the container for one or more plots, and the unfortunately-named `Axes` object (not to be confused with an `Axis` object!) is one of the plots. We can create the `Figure` and `Axes` with another unfortunately-named command: [`pyplot.subplots`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html?highlight=subplots#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots).
